/**
 * Where a photo's background-removed cutout stands, and the one function
 * that decides every change to it. Stored on the photo's `file` row
 * (cutout_status, cutout_attempts, cutout_job_version; src/db/schema.ts)
 * and changed only through applyCutoutEvent (src/cutout/queries.ts), which
 * locks the row, asks transition() and writes what it answers. Nothing else
 * writes those columns.
 *
 *   none ──request──▶ pending ──succeed──▶ ready
 *                      ▲  │  └──fail─────▶ failed
 *                      │  └─start (a job begins: attempts + 1)
 *                      └──retry── pending | failed
 *   any but unwanted ──edit──▶ edited   (the user saved a mask: always wins)
 *   unwanted                            (terminal: no event applies)
 *
 * - none: no server cutout was asked for: a photo stored before
 *   background removal moved to the server (its cutout, if any, was made
 *   in the browser).
 * - unwanted: the photo keeps its background on purpose (an outfit selfie,
 *   #19, src/web/selfies): stored so, and never queued, retried or edited,
 *   so no job, backfill or mask can ever cut the person out of the room.
 *   (none, by contrast, still takes request.)
 * - pending: queued (the database is the queue, src/cutout/queue.ts); a
 *   running job is still pending, with cutout_job_version set by start.
 * - ready / failed: the job's result. failed shows the original and a
 *   "Try again"; the nightly retry requeues failed rows under 3 attempts.
 * - edited: the user's mask; no job result ever replaces it.
 *
 * A job's result (succeed, fail) is accepted only while the row is pending
 * and still on the photo version the job started for: a result for a
 * replaced, edited or requeued photo is discarded, never written.
