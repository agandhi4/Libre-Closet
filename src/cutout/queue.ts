 * start) and nothing is held in memory. Built by createApp() for every app
 * but started only by server.ts, with the model runner; the integration
 * specs start it with a fake one. Stopped by the app's onClose.
 *
 * It looks for work when told to and on its own: wake() from a write in
 * this process; a Postgres notification from a write in any process (the
 * listener, one connection of its own while started); after the listener
 * reconnects (notifications sent meanwhile are lost); and every `pollMs`
 * while idle, the backstop for anything those missed. Two queues on one
 * database (an overlapping deploy) both hear every notification; the claim
 * skips rows locked by the other's claim, but a job stays pending while it
 * runs, so both may run one photo and the state machine keeps one result
 * (claimNextCutout).
