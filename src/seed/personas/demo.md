# demo: Theo Marsh

> A 31-year-old backend engineer in Brooklyn who dresses like he thought about it once, properly, and
> now doesn't have to. Elevated basics all week, a sharper version for meeting days and dates.
> Neutrals so everything goes with everything. Buys in bursts, keeps things for years.

This file is the persona's character bible **and the seed's data**: `npm run seed` reads the tables
below (`src/seed/bible.ts`) and simulates Theo's history from them (`src/seed/simulate.ts`). Edit a
table and the next `--reset` shows it; the prose explains the rules the simulation implements. The
demo doubles as the owner's aspirational target wardrobe (owner, 2026-09-26): what a well-built NYC
tech-worker closet looks like, with real products to Clone and, later, buy (#18, #34).

## Account

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Email | demo@closet.invalid |
| First name | Theo |
| Last name | Marsh |
| Weather home | Fort Greene, Brooklyn |
| Weather location | 40.69, -73.98 |
| Temperature unit | fahrenheit |

`.invalid` is reserved (RFC 2606): the address can never be a real person's or collide with a
household account. The weather home (#14) is Fort Greene Park rounded to two decimals, about a
kilometre, as the app stores every location; he reads temperatures in °F. Riley and Dana have none: the
fresh account's header asks for a city, and Dana has never opened the profile.

## Who he is

- **Theo Marsh**, 31. Senior backend engineer (payments platform) at a ~400-person fintech with an
  office on Broadway at 19th St (Flatiron). Moved to New York from Minneapolis in October 2023 for the
  job; promoted to senior in March 2025.
- Lives in a one-bedroom walk-up in **Fort Greene**, Brooklyn. Commute: Q train DeKalb Av to Union Sq,
  25 minutes door to desk; walks the last blocks up Broadway. No car. Walks everywhere on weekends
  (Fort Greene Park, the Saturday greenmarket, Atlantic Terminal errands, Prospect Heights bars).
- Runs in Fort Greene Park before work twice a week and lifts at a gym on Flatbush on Saturdays.
- Single-ish: has been seeing someone since June; dinner or drinks roughly once a week, usually Friday
  or Saturday.
- Sizes: tops M, trousers 32 waist / 32 leg, belt 34, US shoe 10.
- Budget: most pieces $30-150; a few investment pieces $200-400 (the blazer, the Red Wings, the
  coat), three splurges above that (the AllSaints leather jacket on the October 2025 sale, the
  Patagonia parka for his first winter, the Allen Edmonds for the wedding; kept, owner 2026-09-26).
- Palette: navy, white, grey, black, stone/beige, with olive and brown as accents. One pattern at a
  time (a Breton stripe or a flannel check), never two.

## His week

`Draws from` is the occasions a day's outfit comes from (the Occasion column of Saved outfits).
`Calendar` is the part of the day that outfit is planned for on the calendar (#13: `all-day` or
`work`), and `Workout` the saved outfit of the morning's workout, a calendar entry of its own
(`workout`) before it. The table is also his **week template** (#16, Profile › Your week): each
day's `Calendar` occasion, plus a workout where the day has one (Monday and Thursday runs, the
Saturday gym), which "Plan my week" fills; date nights and nights out come some weeks, not on a
weekday, so they are not in it and he plans them himself.

| Day | Draws from | Calendar | Workout | Where | What he wears | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sun | weekend, wfh | all-day | — | home | lounge, brunch nearby | **laundry** (wash-and-fold on DeKalb Av, 10 am drop-off, 6 pm pick-up) |
| Mon | wfh | all-day | Run | home | lounge: tee or hoodie, joggers or sweatpants, slides | 7 am run |
| Tue | office | work | — | office | smart casual: oxford or knit polo, chinos, loafers or white sneakers | team day |
| Wed | office | work | — | office | smart casual; **the blazer on meeting days** (every other Wednesday: architecture review) | |
| Thu | office | work | Run | office | the most relaxed office day (tee + chore coat or merino, jeans allowed) | 7 am run |
| Fri | wfh | all-day | — | home | casual; **date night** some weeks (Fri or Sat) | |
| Sat | weekend | all-day | Gym | out | gym in the morning, errands and the greenmarket, sometimes dinner or drinks | |

## Events

Days the rules do not decide: `Wears` names the saved outfit worn (or `not recorded`), `Weather` shifts
the day's temperature. Dates are reference dates (see Simulation).

| From | To | Event | Wears | Weather |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-18 | 2026-07-18 | Rockaway Beach with friends | Rockaway | — |
| 2026-07-21 | 2026-07-25 | Heat wave (feels-like 95-100°F) | — | +8 |
| 2026-08-19 | 2026-08-19 | Flies to a conference in Austin (hot) with the duffel and the sling | Conference travel | — |
| 2026-08-20 | 2026-08-20 | At the conference; forgets to log it | not recorded | — |

Shopping bursts are the garments' Acquired dates: the move (2023-10-21), Black Friday 2024
(2024-11-29), the promotion (2025-03-15), summer 2025 (2025-06-14), fall 2025 (2025-10-25), the tee
reset (2026-05-09), the wedding (2026-08-15: tie and dress shoes), the fall refresh (2026-09-12: the
chore coat, the waffle henley, the Red Wings).

## Trips (#10)

The Austin conference of the Events table, as the trip he planned before it: a trip is a standalone list
of outfits for its days and occasions (not the calendar), and its packing list is derived from them. He
packed the night before and left the office outfit and the rooftop evening's out of the duffel until the
morning, so the list is partly packed. Dates are reference dates and move with the Events (see
Simulation); the destination is located (rounded like the weather home) only when the app has weather on.
Written through the trip form (`readTripForm`, `createTrip`), `setTripDestination`, `addTripOutfit`,
`addTripItems`, `setItemsPacked` and `setPacked`.

| Trip | From | To | Destination | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Austin conference | 2026-08-19 | 2026-08-21 | Austin, Texas, United States | 30.27, -97.74 | Hot: nothing that wrinkles, one bag. |

### Trip outfits

`Outfit` is a saved outfit's name; `Occasion` the part of the day it is for (`—`: not said).

| Trip | Day | Occasion | Outfit |

| Austin conference | 2026-08-19 | all-day | Conference travel |
| Austin conference | 2026-08-20 | workout | Run |

| Trip | Garments packed |
|---|---|
| Austin conference | T08, B06, F02, G04, G03, T09, B13, F04, A01 |

## His taste (what he buys, and why)

- **Elevated basics**: Uniqlo U and Everlane for the everyday tees; Buck Mason, COS and J.Crew for the
  heavier and better-cut versions. He learned he prefers a 6-7 oz tee that holds its shape and does
  not show through a chore coat.
- **Smart casual / date-night sharp**: Suitsupply for the blazer and wool trousers, J.Crew for oxfords
  and knit polos, AllSaints for the one good leather jacket, penny loafers and suede Chelsea boots.
- **The tech-worker layer he will not give up**: Patagonia (Better Sweater, Down Sweater, Torrentshell),
  Allbirds, an Aer backpack. He knows.
- **Denim**: a 14.5 oz raw selvedge pair he is breaking in (bought May 2026: not washed yet, on
  purpose), Levi's 501s for everything else, black 511s for nights out.
- **Multiples**: white Uniqlo U tee x3 (one per office day), black Bombas socks x6 (the `Qty` column:
  one garment with that many identical copies, #7).
- **Archived**: the tees and shoes he replaced (kept in the app, not the closet).

## Next buys (his wishlist, #18)

The same grey merino crewneck again, before the old one's elbows go (T21 is `replace_soon`); a padded
shirt jacket for November; and white Allbirds Couriers, the sensible stand-in for the Common Projects
Achilles he keeps talking himself out of. Written with status `wishlist` (the seed's own table below):
not in the closet, the builder, capsules or laundry until "Bought it". Links checked on 2026-09-26
(`verified` = the brand's page or catalog answered). Price is the listed price; no acquired date.

### Wishlist

| id | Name in the app | Brand | Category / type | Colours | Product | Price | Size | Warmth | Form. | Materials | Pattern | Fit | Sleeve | Replaces | Notes |

## His style profile and plan (#34)

What he dresses for and toward: the style profile (`src/wardrobe/style.ts`'s sets, the palette in
`GARMENT_COLORS`). The week's rhythm it shows (work 3× a week, all day 4×, workouts 3×) is derived
from his week template, the week table above (#16), not stored with the profile. His home location
is the weather's (#14), not the profile's. Posted through the style profile form's own validation
(`readStyleProfileForm`).

### Style profile

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Styles | elevated-basics, smart-casual, outdoor-technical |
| Budget | mid |
| Palette | blue, white, grey, black, beige, green, brown |
| Notes | One pattern at a time, never two. A few investment pieces: the blazer, the boots, the coat. |

**His plan** is the closet he built after the move, written as targets (`src/wardrobe/plans.ts`), not
products: his wardrobe mostly fulfils it, which is what the gap view shows. Two gaps on purpose: the
grey merino (T21 is `replace_soon`, so it counts as the gap to refill, not as owned; W01 on the
wishlist is its candidate, 34b) and the padded shirt jacket he wants for November (nothing brown in
his jackets; W02 is its candidate). One partly: three oxfords wanted, two owned (T13, T14; the linen
and denim shirts are not cotton smart-casual). The 501s (B02, `needs_repair`) still count, flagged.
The white heavyweight tee (warmth 3 and up) matches only T06, so it chooses first and "white tee ×3"
takes T01's three copies. Each row goes through the plan item form's validation
(`readPlanItemForm`); `Warmth` and `Form.` are ranges (`3-5`), `—` is any. `(active)` marks the
active plan. `Candidates` are Wishlist ids linked to the item as candidate products (34b), so his
shopping list shows the merino gap with W01 ($49.90, within its $50) and the jacket with W02
($89.90, within $90); the third oxford has none yet.

## His sizes (#24)

What fits him, in Profile › Sizes: his measurements (a tailor took them for the blazer) and the size
he wears in the brands he buys, with how each runs. Private to him; the garment form and his wishlist
show a brand's note, so the two Uniqlo items and the Allbirds on his Wishlist say "Your size in ...".
He reads lengths in inches (`Unit`). Posted through the Sizes editor's own readers
(`readMeasurementsForm`, `readBrandSizeForm`): a length out of range, or a brand with neither a size
nor a note, fails the seed.

### Measurements

| Measurement | Value |
|---|---|
| Unit | in |
| Height | 70 |
| Neck | 15.5 |
| Shoulders | 18 |
| Chest | 39 |
| Sleeve | 34 |
| Waist | 32 |
| Hips | 38 |
| Inseam | 32 |

### Brand sizes

| Brand | Size | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Uniqlo | M | Uniqlo U runs big and boxy: M, never L. Trousers 32. |
| Allbirds | 10 | Whole sizes only; true to size. |
| Red Wing | 9 | Runs large: a full size down from his sneakers. |
| L.L.Bean | 9 | Bean Boots run large: size down. |
| G.H. Bass | 9.5 | Weejuns run half a size large. |
| Suitsupply | 40R | Trousers 32 (EU 48). |
| J.Crew | M | Slim fit in shirts; chinos 32x32. |
| Everlane | M | Runs small, but he likes the tees fitted. |

## What he owns (83 garments: 80 in the closet, 3 archived)

Every garment names a real product on sale on 2026-09-26 (researched and checked that day: `verified`
= the brand's page was fetched; `search` = found in search results, the site blocks bots). Values are
the app's own sets: categories and types from `src/wardrobe/properties.ts`, colours from
`GARMENT_COLORS` (`src/wardrobe/properties.ts`), warmth 1-5, formality 1-4, materials, pattern, fit,
sleeve and length from `properties.ts`. Warmth follows the type preset and weight steps unless marked
`*` (set by hand, as the form allows; the marks differ from the preset on purpose, so "your value is
kept when the type changes" has real examples). Weight is what Theo typed, in oz. `WR` =
water-resistant. Sizes as he types them (`M` is stored `Medium`). Price is what he paid. The seed
posts every row through the garment form's own validation (`readGarmentForm`), so a value the app
would not store fails the seed. `—` is empty.

**Photos are generated art** (owner, 2026-09-26): a flat-lay silhouette of each garment's type in its
colours and pattern, drawn at seed time (`src/seed/art.ts`), stored through `Photos` as its own
cutout. No image files in the repo.

## Saved outfits

Named as he would name them; slots are written in builder order (outerwear, tops, bottoms, footwear,
accessories, bags). `*` after a name = favourite (drawn three times as often). Occasions: `office`,
`meeting`, `rain`, `weekend`, `wfh`, `workout`, `date`, `night-out`, `formal`, `travel`, `beach`; `—`
is never drawn. Bands are the day's feels-like high (see Simulation); `any` is every band.

"Old weekend jeans" was saved in 2025 and is never worn in the window. The workouts (17, 18) are never
drawn: they are the week's `Workout` column, a morning entry before the day's outfit.

## Capsules

Named subsets of the closet (#8), each for a part of his life; the closet itself is every garment
he has not archived and is never a row. A garment can be in several (the white tee is in three).
Written through the app's own writers (`createCapsule`, then `changeMembership`), in this order.
`Garments` are ids.

| Capsule | Garments | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Office | T01, T12, T13, T14, T17, T18, T20, T21, T23, B02, B04, B05, B07, B08, O03, O04, O07, O08, O09, O11, F01, F02, F05, F08, A03, A04, A05, A08, G01 | Tuesday to Thursday at Flatiron: smart casual, the blazer on meeting Wednesdays, jeans only on Thursdays. |
| Weekend | T01, T04, T05, T06, T11, T15, T16, B01, B02, B11, B12, O01, O11, F01, F02, F06, F10, A01, A07, A12, G02, G03, Z03 | Fort Greene Park, the greenmarket, brunch, errands on foot. |
| Date night | T02, T07, T11, T17, T18, T22, T24, B03, B06, B07, O02, O04, F03, F05, F08, A06, A08, A09 | Friday or Saturday: the sharper version of every day. |
| Travel | T01, T08, T09, T13, T18, B02, B06, B13, O08, F02, F04, F11, A07, A11, G03, G04 | The Austin conference duffel: three days, one bag, nothing that wrinkles. |

Weekend still holds the old 511s (Z03), put in before they were archived: a capsule's pages leave an
archived garment out but keep its membership, so the demo shows the rule (22 of 23 shown).

## Laundry

What makes a garment dirty, and so unavailable until Sunday's wash. The app's defaults decide most of
it (#7, `src/wardrobe/availability.ts`: tops and dresses after 1 wear, bottoms after 3, outerwear after
10, footwear, accessories and bags never); this table is where Theo differs, written as each garment's
"Wash after" through the garment form. `Garments` is a role, `type: <types>`, or a garment id; an id
beats a type, a type beats a role. Wears are counted by day, and multiples count copies: three white
tees are three wears.

| Garments | Wears before a wash |
|---|---|
| type: sweater, cardigan, turtleneck, hoodie, sweatshirt | 2 |
| B01 | never |
| A11 | 1 |

B01 is the raw denim: never washed in the window, on purpose. A11 is the socks: an accessory, which the
app never launders by default, but socks go in the wash after every wear.

## Condition

What is wearing out (#7). Still in the closet and still worn: condition never makes a garment
unavailable. Written through the garment form's Condition. Values are the app's (`good`, `needs_repair`,
`replace_soon`); unlisted is `good`.

| Garment | Condition | Note |
|---|---|---|
| T21 | replace_soon | Pilling at the elbows; a new one is on the wishlist |
| B02 | needs_repair | Back belt loop tore off; the tailor on DeKalb Av |

## Away

Out of the closet at the anchor (#7): lent to someone or at a repair shop, so the outfit generator skips
them. Written by the garment page's "Where it is" (`setAway`). Neither is in an outfit he plans to wear.

| Garment | Away | Note |
|---|---|---|
| G04 | lent | Dana has it for her October wedding weekend |
| F07 | repair | Sent back to L.L.Bean for a resole before winter |

## Care labels

What the label inside says (#23), where it differs from what the materials suggest. Every other garment
with a label (not shoes or bags) carries its materials' usual care, as the garment form's material chips
fill it in (`carePresetsFor`, `src/wardrobe/care.ts`); `—` keeps that suggestion. Values are the app's
(`CARE_WASH`, `CARE_BLEACH`, `CARE_DRY`, `CARE_IRON`, `CARE_DRY_CLEAN`). Dry cleaning is never suggested:
only these rows say it.

| Garment | Wash | Bleach | Dry | Iron | Dry cleaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| O03 | do_not_wash | — | — | — | only |
| O04 | do_not_wash | — | — | — | only |
| B07 | do_not_wash | — | — | — | only |
| T22 | — | — | — | — | allowed |
| O05 | — | — | — | — | never |

## Repairs

What has been mended or altered (#23): the garment page's log, the owner's own record. Dated as the
bible's acquisitions are (they move with the anchor), never before the garment was bought; costs are
what he paid, shown beside the log and not added to cost per wear. B02's torn belt loop (Condition) and
F07's resole (Away) are not done yet, so not here.

| Garment | Day | Kind | What was done | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| O03 | 2025-03-22 | alteration | Sleeves shortened 1 cm, the tailor on DeKalb Av | $25 |
| B07 | 2025-03-22 | alteration | Hemmed to a no-break length | $20 |
| B01 | 2026-05-09 | alteration | Chain-stitch hem, 5 cm off, keeping the selvedge | $15 |
| F07 | 2025-02-08 | repair | New laces and the heel re-glued | $12 |
| T13 | 2025-11-08 | repair | Collar button sewn back on | — |

## Clashes

Pairs Theo told the outfit gallery never to put together (#9: "Not this", then the two that clash),
stored through `avoidPair` as `generator_avoid` rows, so the generator never draws them in one idea
again; each garment's page lists its pair with "Allow again". Neither pair is in a saved outfit (the
seed refuses one that is).

| Garment | Never with | Why |
|---|---|---|
| B06 | O11 | Olive chinos under the olive chore coat: one olive too many |
| T15 | O01 | The western denim shirt under the denim jacket: a Canadian tuxedo |

## Simulation (how the history is generated)

The seed does not store a hand-written calendar: it **simulates** Theo's days (`src/seed/simulate.ts`)
from the tables above. Deterministic: every random draw comes from a stream keyed by persona,
subsystem and day (`src/seed/random.ts`), so the same anchor gives the same history, and a new
subsystem never reshuffles an old one's draws.

**Window**: the reference anchor is **Saturday 2026-09-26**. The history is the 91 days ending on the
anchor (the seed's `--anchor`, default today in `APP_TIMEZONE`), then a planned week after it. Seeded on
another date, the reference dates (acquisitions, archives, events) shift by whole weeks so weekdays
keep their meaning, and the weather follows the real dates of the window.

**Weather** (`src/seed/weather.ts`; pure, no network; the app's real forecasts are #14's, from Open-Meteo,
for his weather home; the tests' stand-in for Open-Meteo serves these same simulated days, hour by hour, so
the planned week's weather on the calendar is the weather it was drawn for):
- Daily normal high for Central Park by day of year (1991-2020 normals, linearly interpolated between
  month mid-points): Jan 39, Feb 42, Mar 50, Apr 62, May 72, Jun 80, Jul 84, Aug 83, Sep 76, Oct 64,
  Nov 54, Dec 44 °F.
- Noise: an AR(1) anomaly (persistence 0.6, sd 5 °F), so warm and cool spells last a few days, plus the
  Events' shifts. Humidity adds up to 6 °F of feels-like above 80 °F.
- Rain: a probability by month (Jul 0.30, Aug 0.28, Sep 0.25; NOAA's days with 0.1 in or more).
- Bands on the feels-like high: **hot** 85 and up, **warm** 75-84, **mild** 65-74, **cool** 52-64,
  **cold** 38-51, **freezing** under 38. As the app's weather matching (`src/weather/match.ts`) reads the
  same days, each band asks for a torso warmth (top plus layer) in a range: hot 1-2, warm 1-4, mild 3-5,
  cool 4-7, cold 6-9, freezing 8-9, rising band by band (`weather.spec.ts`).
- Each day as a forecast: the feels-like runs from its low at 6:00 to its high at 15:00 (a 12 to 18 °F
  swing), and a rainy day's rain is a spell of 3 to 8 hours starting between 6:00 and 18:00.

**Each day**:
1. The Event's outfit, if the day has one. Otherwise the week's `Draws from`; a meeting Wednesday
   (every other Wednesday, the reference 2026-07-01 first) draws `meeting` instead of `office`.
2. Candidates: saved outfits with one of those occasions whose bands include the day's; minus any with
   a garment not yet acquired, archived by then, or dirty (Laundry). With none left, the neighbouring
   band is tried, then dirty garments are allowed (he wears it again).
3. Draw with weights: 1, favourites 3; × 0.2 if worn yesterday, × 0.5 if worn in the three days before;
   × 4 for a `rain` outfit on a rainy day.
4. **Evenings**: a `date` outfit in three weeks out of four (probability 0.75), on Friday (60 %) or
   Saturday; a `night-out` every third week on Thursday or Saturday. The evening is a second calendar
   entry that day, planned for the `evening` (a date) or the `night-out`.
5. **Workouts**: the week's `Workout` outfit in the morning (the Monday and Thursday runs, the Saturday
   gym), a calendar entry for the `workout` before the day's own; skipped one time in five, when the
   day's band is not one of the outfit's (no run in freezing weather), and on Event days. The day's
   outfit is planned for its week row's `Calendar` occasion (an Event's outfit the weekday does not draw
   from, the wedding or the beach, is `all-day`). A day of a run, the office and a night out is three
   entries; a garment in two of a day's entries is one wear.
6. **Logging**: Theo records a past day on 85 % of days; a recorded past entry is worn (that evening,
   21:00). On 4 % of office days the planned outfit stayed unworn (rain changed his mind) and the one he
   wore is a second, worn entry. Before a date or a night out he takes a mirror selfie: every worn
   `evening` and `night-out` entry of the last 28 days has one (#19; a drawing of the outfit's garments
   on him in the hall mirror, `src/seed/selfie-art.ts`), stored through the selfie's own writer, which
   marks the entry worn.
7. **Planned week**: the seven days after the anchor, planned and not worn. He plans by hand only
   what comes some weeks (a date night, a night out, drawn by the same rules) and an Event's outfit;
   the rest, his week template's slots (the day's outfit, the workouts), is **"Plan my week"** (#16):
   the app's own planner over his closet as the anchor leaves it (the week's wears still in the
   hamper), with the forecast the tests' Open-Meteo stand-in serves for those days, each entry
   marked Auto. The rules still draw every day's outfit, so the evenings are the ones they always
   were.
   **The anchor is today, half lived** (Today, #15): the morning's workout is done and worn (by the
   end of its window, 9:00), the evening planned and not worn yet, and the day's own outfit not
   chosen, so Today suggests one; an Event's outfit is decided already and planned. At the reference
   anchor that is Saturday's date night, "Summer date", with three ideas for the day. The day's
   outfit is still drawn, unrecorded, so the planned week is the one it always was.
8. **Laundry Sundays** wash everything worn since the last wash that ever gets washed (the rules in
   Laundry): each garment's `last_washed_on` is its last Sunday up to the anchor. A day's wears are
   counted once, however many outfits that day used the garment, as the app counts them. The anchor is a
   Saturday, so the week's wears are still in the hamper: the demo's laundry page is Saturday afternoon's.
9. **Wears**: every worn entry is marked through the app's own `setEntryWorn`, so each garment's wear
   log is the outfits' garments on those days.

**Seasonal drift**: the rules choose by band, not by month. At the reference anchor the window is a
warm summer: shorts, linen, the sweater-polo and slides; the raw denim (bands `mild`, `cool`) mostly sits
out, and the chore coat arrives for the first cool Thursday. The winter pieces (parka, Bean Boots, coat,
gloves, scarf, beanie, cashmere, Down Sweater) and the garments no saved outfit uses are never worn in
the window, which is what an "unworn in 90 days" insight (#17) should flag. Seeded in January, the same
rules reach for the merino office outfit, the leather jacket and the hoodie.

**What later features add** (plan section 10): wears and washes (#7, done: quantities 3 and 6, the
worn entries as wears, laundry Sundays as washes, the Condition and Away tables), occasions on each entry (#13, done: work days, evenings and nights out, the morning workouts), weather (#14, done: his
Fort Greene home in °F, the simulated days served as forecasts in the tests), the conference as a trip
with a packing list (#10, done: the Trips tables, partly packed; the Travel capsule is its pool), the gallery's clashes (#9, done: the Clashes
table, olive chinos + olive chore coat and the double denim), and the Next buys as wishlist items (#18,
done: the Wishlist table, W01 replacing T21). The outfit gallery (#9, done) draws its ideas from the
closet or a capsule, rotating what the simulation left unworn. Wardrobe plans (#34a, done: the style
profile and "NYC minimal" above, whose gaps are the replace-soon merino and the padded
jacket); the shopping list (#34b, done: the plan table's Candidates) pairs those gaps with W01 and W02.
Today (#15, done): the anchor is today, half lived (step 7), so his home screen shows the evening's
plan and ideas for the day. Outfit selfies (#19, done): his recent evenings carry a mirror selfie (step
6), so the calendar's history weeks and his date-night outfits' Worn strips show the looks.
The weekly auto-plan (#16, done): his week template is the week table, and the planned week is "Plan my week"'s (step 7).
Sizes (#24, done): his measurements and brand notes are the His sizes tables, so the wishlist shows his size in Uniqlo and Allbirds.
Care labels and repairs (#23, done): every labelled garment carries its materials' care, the Care labels table
where the label says otherwise (the blazer, coat and flannels dry clean only), and the Repairs table's log.
The year in review (#26, done): the thirteen weeks and the year's acquisitions are his "2026 so far"; nothing is added for it.
