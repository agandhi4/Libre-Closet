/**
 * Where a Muse outfit is in the owner's reaction to their agent's design
 * (#335; first the plans' looks, #290): an outfit the agent proposed,
 * owned garments and its suggestions together. Stored as outfit.reaction
 * (a check constraint lists LOOK_REACTIONS), null on an outfit of the
 * owner's own, written `proposed` by the outfit writer's proposal and
 * changed afterwards only by reactToOutfit (src/web/outfits/reactions.ts),
 * which holds the owner lock, asks lookReactionTransition and writes what
 * it answers. Pure.
 *
 *   event        from                       to         owner's note
 *   love         proposed, revise           loved      cleared
 *   change       proposed, loved            revise     written (required)
 *   decline      proposed, revise, loved    declined   written (optional)
 *   repropose    revise, loved              proposed   kept
 *   reconsider   declined                   proposed   cleared
 *
 * - proposed: the agent wrote it (proposed, or changed it) and the owner
 *   has not reacted.
 * - loved: "Love it". Not final: the owner may still ask for a change or
 *   turn it down.
 * - revise: "Change this" (the owner's note required): waiting on the agent.
 * - declined: "Not for me" (a note optional). Kept, not deleted, so the
 *   agent never proposes its exact pieces again.
 *
 * Who moves what:
 * - love, change, decline, reconsider: the owner.
 * - love from revise: the owner takes the look as it was after all.
 * - decline from revise or loved: the owner changes their mind.
 * - repropose: the agent's update of a look sent back or loved. An agent
 *   editing its own still-proposed look is a content edit, not a move;
 *   anything the agent would do to a declined look is refused.
 *
 * Refused on purpose: every self-move (events name the move, so a stale
 * page or a double tap cannot apply one twice).
