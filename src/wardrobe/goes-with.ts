/**
 * "Goes with my closet" (#18b; docs/plans/2026-09-26-wardrobe-features.md,
 * section 11): a wishlist item judged against the closet, pure. Every
 * outfit comes from the generator (generateIdeas), with the item `locked`
 * the way `?with=` locks a closet garment, so the colour, pattern and clash
 * rules are the gallery's and nowhere else. The caller
 * (goesWithCloset, src/web/gallery/ideas.ts) reads the item, the closet and
 * the avoided pairs; the item only ever rides along as `locked`, never in a
 * pool, so no other surface can draw it.
 *
 * What is judged, and why:
 * - **No weather.** A purchase is worn across seasons: today's forecast
 *   would make a winter coat "go with nothing" in July, and the answer
 *   change daily. Without a forecast the generator draws no layer, so
 *   layers are judged one by one (layerChecks), each locked with the item.
 * - **No occasion, but the item's own formality** as the range: the
 *   generator's formality score then ranks outfits by how far their pieces
 *   dress from the item, so the best few are the coherent ones (a merino
 *   crewneck with chinos and loafers before joggers and slides). An item
 *   without a formality ranks nothing.
 * - **No rotation.** How long a closet garment has rested says nothing
 *   about whether it goes with something not yet bought, and it would bias
 *   the counts toward rested pieces: the closet is drawn uniformly.
 */

/**
 * The most outfits the count names; past it the answer is "50+". One search
 * finds every distinct outfit it meets in MAX_DRAWS draws: exact for a
 * closet where the item makes fewer (the search space is then small enough
 * to be walked many times over), a sample past it, where the number would
 * say more about the draws than about the item.
