 * turned down and stands in for `to-buy`, so the two never meet; only a
 * wishlist garment is set aside (buying one keeps its `dismissedAt`).
 *
 * The badge itself (one daisyUI variant and one string per mark) is
 * `<GarmentMark>`, src/web/layout/garment-mark.tsx; this is the rule every
 * surface derives its marks with, so a mark means the same thing on each.
