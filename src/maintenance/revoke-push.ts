/**
 * `npm run push:revoke-all`: removes every account's push subscriptions, the
 * step after rotating ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET (CLAUDE.md, Deployment). A
 * rotation signs everyone out, and a signed-out device receives nobody's
 * notifications; each device drops its own subscription the next time it
 * opens the app (the login page, <push-signed-out>), but one left closed
 * would keep getting its account's reminders, which name planned outfits on
 * the lock screen. Kept apart from the entry point (revoke-push.cli.ts) so
 * the integration tier can run it against a scratch database.
 *
 * Run it after the server restarted with the new secret: before that, a
 * session still open sends its subscription again on its next page
 * (syncSubscription, public/js/push.js). Everyone re-enables notifications
 * and their reminders on the profile afterwards.
