/**
 * The column steps of a wide page, named once beside the width tokens
 * (`page-main.tsx`) so a gallery never copies `grid-cols-*`. Responsive from
 * one markup: CSS breakpoints only, the phone layout is the unprefixed class.
 * Whole class names, so Tailwind finds them.
 *
 *  - `GALLERY_GRID`: photo tiles; three on a phone (the plan's density), six
 *    at `lg`. The Wardrobe grid and the capsule page's members.
 *  - `CARD_COLUMNS`: blocks of mixed height (Insights' cards) flowing down
 *    CSS columns, so a short card leaves no hole: one on a phone (stacked
 *    with the same 1rem gap), two at `lg`, three at `xl`.
 *  - `CANDIDATE_GRID`: large product photos with their price and actions
 *    under them (the shopping list's candidates): two on a phone, four at
 *    `lg`.
 *  - `PAIR_GRID`: two side by side from `lg` (Today's rows: the planned
 *    suggestion beside the ideas strip; a lone ideas row spans both and
 *    shows two ideas at a time).
