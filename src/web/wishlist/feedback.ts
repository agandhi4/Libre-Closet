/**
 * What the owner decided about the agent's work since the agent last
 * asked (#337, get_suggestion_feedback; doc section 6): the agent's way to
 * learn, since closet stores no taste model. Read from the rows the
 * decisions left, never a log of its own:
 * - a need's decision at `option_group.decided_at` (chosen, bought, set
 *   aside with its reason and the owner's note);
 * - a pick set aside at `garment.dismissed_at` (Not for me with a reason,
 *   chose another, returned);
 * - a purchase at `garment.bought_at` (setGarmentStatus' buy), with the
 *   price paid: a pick, or "a different one" that settled a need;
 * - an outfit's reaction at `outfit.reacted_at` (Love, Not for me, Undo);
 * - and every bought suggestion's wears, whatever the cursor: the signal
 *   that grows.
 *
 * **The cursor** is the calling token's `feedback_read_at`: null before
 * its first call, so a new token (Muse's rotated one) hears everything.
 * A row whose time is null (the plan looks' reactions 0041 migrated, a
 * purchase before 0042) is older than any cursor: it is told on a first
 * call only, or with `all`. The call moves the cursor to its statement's
 * `now()` less OWNER_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS: a decision stamps its transaction's
 * start, which may come before this read while it waits on the owner
 * lock and commits after it, and that wait is bounded by the lock's
 * timeout. So a decision is never skipped, and one may be told twice
 * (ids say which). State, not events: an Undo since leaves the row as it
 * was before the decision, so the agent sees it in list_suggestions.
 * One statement, the cursor's move a data-modifying CTE of it.
