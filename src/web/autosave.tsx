/**
 * Save-on-change ("autosave") controls: every form or control that posts on
 * `change` is built here (`AutosaveForm`, or `autosaveAttributes` for
 * controls inside a larger form), so none of them loses a quick edit.
 * `expectAutosaveControls` (test/integration/pages.ts) fails a page with a
 * change-triggered post built any other way. Found on #62's reminders form;
 * test/autosave.spec.ts changes each family on a slow network.
 *
 * What went wrong before, in htmx 2: a change made while the form's save was
 * in flight is queued on the element that issued it and re-issued when the
 * save's answer has been swapped in, reading the form at that moment; an
 * answer that replaced that element (`outerHTML` on the form's section)
 * dropped the queued save with it, and an answer that re-rendered the
 * controls put back what the person had changed since. The rules:
 *
 * 1. **One queue per form, the latest last** (`hx-sync="closest form:queue
 *    last"`, the form itself for an `AutosaveForm`): nothing is in flight
 *    twice, so the server applies saves in order, and a change made while one
 *    is in flight replaces any save still waiting.
 * 2. **Each save posts the whole form**, read when it is sent (htmx includes
 *    the enclosing form in every non-GET request): the last save carries every
 *    change, those whose own requests were replaced in the queue included.
 * 3. **The answer never replaces the element that posts**, where htmx keeps
 *    the queue and its listeners (a swapped-in trigger listens only after the
 *    settle delay). It goes into the form's status line (`AutosaveStatus`,
 *    the default: the controls are the person's and the server only confirms)
 *    or, where the server must redraw controls (a type's presets), into a
 *    region's contents (`innerHTML`). And an answer overtaken by an edit is
 *    not swapped in at all (public/js/autosave.js): the edit's own save is
 *    queued behind it and its answer lands instead, built from the whole
 *    latest form. So no answer is ever older than the controls it redraws.
 *
 * Other swaps must not replace an autosave form either: a queued save dies
 * with its element. Sibling writes answer regions beside it (the wear
 * section's buttons, the weather's other forms).
 */
