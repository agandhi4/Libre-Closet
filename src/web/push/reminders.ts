/**
 * The push reminders (#15; plan section 9, issue #5's answer): a morning
 * "Today's outfit" and an evening "What did you wear?", each at a time the
 * device chose (opt-in per device, the profile's settings). Both open
 * Today. sendDueReminders is one run: scheduled every minute by server.ts
 * (scheduleMinutely), never by createApp(), so the integration harness
 * and the CLIs send nothing on their own; a spec calls it with the instant
 * it wants.
 *
 * A run: what is due (dueReminders, pure: the time in APP_TIMEZONE, set
 * before it, at most LATE_LIMIT_MINUTES ago), claimed in the database
 * (claimReminders: push_reminder's primary key, so two servers overlapping
 * in a deploy never both send), then composed per person from the same
 * Today model the page shows and sent to the claiming devices only. The
 * evening one is skipped when anything is marked worn today. A claim is
 * taken before sending: a crash between the two loses that reminder rather
 * than sending it twice (the notification's tag would stack nothing, but a
 * reminder is not worth a second buzz).
 *
 * **The morning one describes the day after its re-plan** (#76): before
 * composing it, the person's re-plan for today runs if nothing has run it
 * yet (replanToday, src/web/week-plan/replan.ts, once a day per user
 * whoever asks, the claim committed with the work). So a 05:00 reminder
 * never names an outfit the day's own re-plan is about to swap, whatever
 * the two minute timers' order, and with two servers the one that loses
 * the claim waits for the other's re-plan to commit before reading. What
 * that re-plan swapped today is said in the reminder itself, first ("Swapped
 * in Wool coat: it turned cold"): one push, not a swap notice beside it;
 * other days' swaps still get the re-plan's notice.
