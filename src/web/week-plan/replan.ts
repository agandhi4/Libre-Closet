/**
 * The daily re-plan (#16; plan section 12): each morning the week
 * planner's own entries (planned_by 'auto', not worn, today on) are judged
 * again (replanWeek, src/wardrobe/week-planner.ts): an outfit that can no
 * longer be worn on its day (a garment lent, at repair, archived or
 * deleted, or today without a clean copy: unwearableOn) is swapped for the
 * slot's best idea; one whose forecast changed is kept while it still fits
 * and swapped for a better idea when it does not. Entries a person planned,
 * edited or wore are 'user' and never read here. What swapped is pushed to
 * the person's devices that take the morning reminder.
 *
 * replanToday is one user's re-plan for the day, once: the minutely run
 * (replanWeeks) calls it for every user due one from REPLAN_HOUR, and the
 * morning reminder (src/web/push/reminders.ts) calls it for its user
 * before describing the day, so a reminder always names the plan after
 * the re-plan, whatever time it is set to (#76). "Once" is week_replan's
 * primary key, claimed inside the work's own transaction under lockOwner
 * (claimReplan): a second caller (another minute, the reminder, a second
 * server in an overlapping deploy) waits on the owner lock and finds the
 * day claimed and the re-plan committed, never half done. server.ts
 * schedules the run, never createApp(), so the integration harness and the
 * CLIs never re-plan on their own (a spec calls it with the instant it
 * wants).
 */

 * before the reminder rather than after it. The reminder does not rely on
 * it (it re-plans its user first); this is for the people without one.
 * Derived, not a second constant: moving the window moves it. On the wall
 * clock (hourIn): the window keeps away from the hours DST skips.
