 * (src/wardrobe/week-planner.ts, pure) fed from the database and the
 * forecast, and its writes. Called by POST /calendar/plan-week (routes.tsx),
 * the MCP tool plan_week and the seed; the daily re-plan (replan.ts) shares
 * writeAutoPick and the window's reads.
 *
 * A plan is one transaction under lockOwner: the template, the week's
 * entries and the pool are read after the lock, so a second tap (or a
 * retried plan_week) waits for the first, finds its slots filled and plans
 * nothing. Every outfit is written through pickIdea (the gallery's pick:
 * an outfit of exactly those garments reused, else created and named),
 * planned for its slot with planned_by 'auto', and recorded with its batch
 * and the targets it was planned for.
