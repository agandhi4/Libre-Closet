 * writeAutoPick and the window's reads.

 * A plan is one transaction under lockOwner: the template, the week's
 * entries and the pool are read after the lock, so a second tap (or a
 * retried plan_week) waits for the first, finds its slots filled and plans
 * nothing. Every outfit is written through pickIdea (the gallery's pick:
 * an outfit of exactly those garments reused, else created and named),
 * planned for its slot with planned_by 'auto', and recorded with its batch
 * and the targets it was planned for.
