/**
 * Deletes the owner's outfit; its slots and calendar entries cascade, but

 * turns its entries' wears into day-level wears first, in the same
 * transaction. Never replace this with a plain delete: the cascade through
 * outfit_calendar would erase the garments' wear history (CLAUDE.md, Wears
 * and washes). The entries' selfies stay too, by their foreign key
 * (selfie.outfit_calendar_id, ON DELETE SET NULL): each becomes a look kept
 * on its day, with its photo, which the calendar still shows (#19). Its
 * trips lose it by trip_outfit's cascade, and their packed marks for the
 * garments no other trip outfit holds go too (prunePacked, #10).
 * Undefined when the outfit is not the owner's; else the wears kept.
 * Under the owner lock, before the outfit's (its entries go with it; the
 * re-plan and Undo call it holding the lock already).
