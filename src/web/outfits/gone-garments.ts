 * - `owned`: a slot write into an outfit something holds (a calendar
 *   entry, a trip: outfitIsHeld): the closet and the archive, so an outfit
 *   keeps an archived garment.
 * - `considered`: a slot write into an outfit nothing holds (createOutfit,
 *   updateOutfit: the outfit form, Styling's Save of a saved outfit,
 *   create_outfit, the seed): owned, or on the wishlist. Such an outfit is
 *   incomplete until the piece is bought (src/web/outfits/references.ts).
 * A slot write's mode is the outfit's, never the caller's (slotHoldsSql).
 * The same rules in SQL: a pick's locked read keeps inCloset()
 * (pickedGarments, src/web/gallery/queries.ts), a slot write's
