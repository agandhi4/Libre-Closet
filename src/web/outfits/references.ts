/**
 * What holds an outfit: a calendar entry (any day, worn or not) and a trip

 * for photos. "Delete an outfit once nothing holds it" (the planner's
 * outfits, removeUnheldOutfits: Undo, the re-plan's swap, Change) asks
 * this, because deleteOutfit cascades every holder: a holder missing here
 * is a row silently deleted with the outfit (a trip lost its outfit and
 * its packing list that way). A new table with an `outfit_id` must be
 * added here. Its slots (outfit_slot) are its own parts, not holders, and
 * a plan look saved as it (plan_look.outfit_id, #292) is not one either:
 * that link is ON DELETE SET NULL and the look offers Save again, so
 * looks stay out of the deletion and week-planner rules (owner decision).
 * Were one added, its nullable column would need `is not null` here, or
 * `not in` is null and nothing is ever removed.
 *
 * Uncorrelated on purpose, for the reason photoIsReferenced gives: in a
 * single-table select drizzle writes a SQL field's columns without their
 * table, so a correlated `outfit_calendar.outfit_id = outfit.id` would
 * compare outfit_calendar's own columns. Both columns are not null, so
 * `not in` is never null.

 *   holds (slotHoldsSql, src/web/outfits/gone-garments.ts: insertSlots);

 * closet garments (pickIdea), so nothing else can reach one; the
 * generator's memory leaves incomplete outfits out (savedSlotsSql), or a
 * pick its drawn roles share with one would never be suggested.
 *
 * Bought it completes an outfit (the garment leaves the wishlist); nothing
 * in the outfit is written. Derived on every read, never stored.
