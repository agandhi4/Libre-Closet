 * outfit is on is derived, never stored:
 * - **the owner's** (`ownersOutfit`): never proposed, or a proposal loved
 *   while complete ("Save" is Love on a complete outfit). The Saved grid,
 *   the pickers, the garment page's strip.
 * - **from Muse** (`awaitingOwner`): proposed or sent back, or loved but
 *   still holding a piece to buy. The Outfits tab's first section.
 * - **set aside**: declined, with a reason. Collapsed under it, to undo.
 * Bought it moves a loved outfit from Muse's to the owner's by itself.
