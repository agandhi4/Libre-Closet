/**
 * /file/**: photo variants and share-preview images. Public: every path here
 * is under the /file/ static prefix (static-prefixes.ts), so the root hook
 * resolves no session and builds no page context, and a page added here
 * would render without one. Photos are addressed by unguessable UUID names;
 * share previews and Open Graph images must load for anyone. Outfit selfies
 * are the exception: only their owner sees them (GET /selfies/*, session
 * checked, src/web/selfies/routes.ts), so here their names are a 404 like
 * a missing photo, and knowing one is not a way in. Failures answer the
 * error handler's bare `{ statusCode, message }` (no page context).
 *
 * A URL imageUrl signed is served without a statement (#162): the
 * signature proves the name is no selfie's and names the set to serve.
 * Anything else asks the row (publicPhoto), one statement, as every photo
 * request did before.
