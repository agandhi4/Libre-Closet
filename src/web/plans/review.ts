/**
 * The plan review (#271, #278, epic #268): what an agent proposed, reviewed
 * the way Styling composes. One strip per proposed item (the shared snap
 * strip, src/web/strip/), its tiles Don't buy, Change this…, Keep and the
 * item's wishlist candidates; the centred tile is the pick. Under each
 * strip a note for the agent; on each candidate a "Not this one" box with
 * an optional reason. One post, "Accept these", decides every item the
 * page showed, in one owner transaction through the plans' own writers:
 *
 * - A candidate or Keep accepts the item; Don't buy declines it (its note
 *   optional) and Change this sends it back to the agent (its note
 *   required: a blank one is the page again, 400, with every pick kept).
 *   Both are review moves (reviewItems, src/wardrobe/plan-review.ts): the
 *   row stays, so the agent sees why. Only items in `shown` that are still
 *   proposed are touched: one proposed after the page was drawn is left
 *   for the next review, one decided meanwhile (a second post, the item
 *   form) is not decided again.
 * - "Not this one" records the product and the reason (plan_item_rejection,
 *   rejections.ts) and lets the candidate go, ticked box or not.
 * - With "Remove the products I didn't pick" ticked (it starts unticked),
 *   the unpicked candidates of a picked item and every candidate of a
 *   declined one are let go too.
 * - What is let go is judged only among the candidates the strip offered
 *   (each strip posts the candidates it drew, so one linked after the page
 *   was drawn is never judged by a choice made without it) that are still
 *   the item's. One is deleted from the wishlist (deleteGarment,
 *   'wishlist') only when every plan item it stands for (any plan, any
 *   review: candidaciesOf) is one of this post that lets it go, no item
 *   here picked it, and no look, outfit or capsule holds it
 *   (garmentsInUse: a look's to-buy piece stays in its slot); one bought meanwhile is kept (the delete judges the
 *   status under the row lock), and logged. One kept because it stands for
 *   something else is unlinked from each item here that let it go
 *   (changeCandidates), so a rejected product leaves the item and frees its
 *   place under the cap.
 * - A changed item lets nothing go but what was rejected: the agent sees
 *   what it offered.
 * - With "Make this my plan" (an inactive plan only), setActivePlan.
 * - The looks (#291): one strip of the plan's loved and proposed looks,
 *   each tile with Love it, Change this… (its note required, as an item's)
 *   and Not for me. Only looks the strip drew (`look`) are touched, each
 *   through reactToLooks (looks.ts, src/wardrobe/look-reaction.ts), so a
 *   look the agent added after the page was drawn waits for the next
 *   review, one left alone keeps its reaction, and one that moved meanwhile
 *   takes only what the machine allows from where it is. Nothing a look
 *   does deletes or unlinks anything.
 *
 * The removed photos' bytes go after the commit (the photo contract), as
 * "Bought it"'s do (purchase.ts).
