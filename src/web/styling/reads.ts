 * a scalar subquery its module owns (queries.ts, capsules', the
 * gallery's, sharing's), read together through selectScalars, as
 * gridContext does for the wardrobe grid. Two statements at most after
 * the session (and a shared wardrobe's share, and a trip's aim):
 * - stripsReads: the strips' windows and whatever the page needs beside
 *   them. The page without "Style this", "Add row" and a refused Save are
 *   this one statement.
 * - ideaReads: what the generator draws from, and the garments it locks,
 *   with the request's own checks. Shuffle and "Style this" read it
 *   first, since the windows must reach the idea's garments, which only
 *   the generator knows; then stripsReads for the windows.
 * The checks ride in the statement and are judged after it (the routes):
 * the capsule (null when it is not the wardrobe's, whose garments then
 * match nothing: inCapsule), the outfit (the requester's own) and the
 * posted garments (fewer than asked: the rows fall back to "No garment").
