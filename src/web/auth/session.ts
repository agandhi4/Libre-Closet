 * the row is read fresh because comparing its fingerprint is the

 *
 * A cookie that no longer opens a session is ended here, on whatever route
 * it arrives (endSession: the cookie cleared, Clear-Site-Data sent). That
 * covers every way a session ends away from this device: a password changed
 * on another one or by `user:set-password` (the fingerprint), the account
 * deleted elsewhere (no row), a rotated ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET or a garbled
 * token (the signature), and expiry. This is the one place such a device is
 * noticed, so it is where it drops the account's HTTP cache (selfies,
 * pages); the session gate's redirect or 401 then carries both headers, and
 * the login page it lands on drops the browser's push subscription
 * (PushSignedOut, src/web/push/settings.tsx). A request without the cookie
 * gets neither header: nothing was signed in there.
