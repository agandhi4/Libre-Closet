 * ACCOUNT_LIMIT, LINK_IMPORT_LIMIT, WEATHER_SEARCH_LIMIT, MCP_LIMIT). Every limited route counts
 * on its own. Counters live in
 * process memory, which is right for the single container this runs as.

 * The client address is `request.ip`, which Fastify takes from
 * X-Forwarded-For only when the peer is in TRUSTED_PROXIES. Behind Caddy,
 * TRUSTED_PROXIES must include Caddy's address, or every visitor shares
 * Caddy's IP and one person's typos lock out the household (CLAUDE.md,
