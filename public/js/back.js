/**
 * The app bar's back arrow (src/web/layout/app-bar.tsx, `data-history-back`)
 * goes back like a native app's: to the page the user came from, as history
 * holds it (htmx's snapshot: Styling's rows as they were left), whenever
 * that page is in the app. On a cold entry (a shared link, a push
 * notification, a fresh launch of the installed app) there is nothing in the
 * app to go back to, and the arrow follows its href, the page's fixed
 * parent, as the boosted link it is.
 *
 * "The previous entry is in the app" is recorded, never guessed. Every
 * history entry this tab makes carries its trail, the app's entries from the
 * cold one up to itself, in history.state:
 *  - history.state is per entry, so back/forward, a reload and the bfcache
 *    each find the trail of the entry they land on; it is per tab, and it
 *    works everywhere, iOS Safari standalone included (the Navigation API
 *    reached Safari only in 26.x, and would need this as its fallback).
 *  - A same-origin document.referrer cannot tell: a boosted navigation never
 *    changes it. sessionStorage cannot either: nothing in the History API
 *    says which entry a back/forward landed on.
 * htmx overwrites an entry's state with `{htmx: true}` when it snapshots the
 * page (before every navigation, and on every history restore), so the
 * trail on screen is kept here and written back after each.
 *
 * A native post (every PostForm, src/web/auth/form.tsx) loads a new
 * document, whose entry starts without state: the submit hands the trail
 * over in sessionStorage, and the next document takes it only when its
 * referrer is the page that posted (a push notification's navigation never
 * matches).
 *
 * A form page (AppBar `formPage`: an edit or add page, Styling where it can
 * save) is done once saved or cancelled. Its Cancel (`CancelLink`) is a back
 * arrow too, and on a cold entry, where the arrow and Cancel go forward to
 * their href, that entry counts as the form's exit. The page its save or
 * exit lands on goes back past it, past a refused attempt's
 * re-render, and past the entries of its own page (the garment as it was
 * before the edit). Garment, Edit, Save, back: to where the garment page was
 * opened from, never to the stale form. "Its own page" is the pathname: a
 * page that saves in place lands on itself with a flag in the query
 * (`?saved=1`), and back from it skips the copy from before the save.
 *
 * A save makes what history holds stale: htmx's snapshots (and a bfcached
 * document) were taken before it, so the Wardrobe went back to showing the
 * garment's old name. Each trail entry keeps when its page was rendered
 * (`at`), a native post records when the tab last saved (sessionStorage),
 * and an entry restored from history that was rendered before that save is
 * reloaded in place (no new entry; its trail survives in history.state, and
 * the reload renders it anew). Every stale entry refreshes once, however far
 * back; one rendered after the last save (anything after signing in) is
 * restored as it was. A document a back/forward loads again counts as
 * restored (the browser's HTTP cache answers it). htmx writes (autosave,
 * hx-post) are not saves here: they answer the part of the page they change.
 *
 * Evaluated once per document (a module; boosted navigations swap only the
 * body): the listeners sit on the document and the window.
