# Closet

A private, self-hosted household wardrobe PWA. Catalog garments with photos (backgrounds removed automatically), compose outfits, plan them on a calendar, and share a wardrobe between users.

## Quick start

Closet needs a PostgreSQL 13+ database (production runs 17).

```yaml
services:
  closet:
    image: ghcr.io/agandhi4/closet:latest
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    volumes:
      - closet_data:/app/data
    environment:
      # Required: signs the session cookies. openssl rand -hex 32
      ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: '<secret>'
      # The household's time zone: decides "today" on the calendar.
      APP_TIMEZONE: America/New_York
      PWA_ENABLED: 'true'
      # Required when PWA_ENABLED is true: npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
      PUBLIC_VAPID_KEY: '<public key>'
      PRIVATE_VAPID_KEY: '<private key>'
      DATA_PATH: /app/data
      DATABASE_HOST: postgres
      DATABASE_SCHEMA: closet
      DATABASE_USER: closet
      DATABASE_PASS: '<password>'
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: unless-stopped
  postgres:
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: closet
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: '<password>'
      POSTGRES_DB: closet
    volumes:
      - closet_pg:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD-SHELL', 'pg_isready -U closet -d closet']
      interval: 5s
      retries: 10
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  closet_data:
  closet_pg:
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and register an account: login is always required. Once everyone in the household has signed up, set `DISABLE_REGISTRATION=true`.

## Connect your Claude

Closet is an MCP server: your own Claude (Claude Code, Claude Desktop) can search your wardrobe, add pieces from product links, build outfits and capsules, plan days, keep track of wears and laundry, and compare your closet with a wardrobe shared with you to talk through what to buy next.

1. In the app, open **Profile › Agent Access** (`/auth/tokens`) and create a token; it asks for your password, since a token keeps working after you sign out. The token is shown once, and the page also shows the command below with it filled in.
2. Add the server to Claude Code:

   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport http closet https://closet.kashhq.dedyn.io/mcp \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
   ```

   Use your own `SITE_URL` in place of the address. In Claude Desktop, add the same URL and header as a remote MCP server.

The token acts as you, shares included: a wardrobe shared with you read-only stays read-only. Tools that write say so, and none deletes anything. Revoke a token on the same page; changing your password revokes every token. The endpoint is rate-limited per token. The app is reachable only over the tailnet; an agent off the tailnet uses the public endpoint instead: `https://closet-mcp.kashhq.com/mcp`, the same `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, Streamable HTTP (`POST`, JSON answers). It exists only when the owner deploys the homelab gate (a Caddy that forwards `POST /mcp` and answers 404 to everything else); the app's pages stay tailnet-only. Anything that can send a bearer header can use it; Claude's hosted connectors (claude.ai) that need OAuth still cannot, because OAuth is not built.

### Styling with an agent

An agent connected this way (Claude, or a styling agent such as Muse) can draft a wardrobe plan for you without touching the plan you keep.

1. **Connect** it as above, with a token of its own named for it (`Muse`): the name is how the app tells you who drafted what.
2. **The workflow** the server describes to the agent: it reads your style profile, your whole closet in one call (with how often each piece is worn, and a garment's photo where it needs to see one), your wear statistics and your active plan's gaps, so it builds on what you own: it does not propose what the closet already covers, treats pieces marked replace soon as gaps, and names in each item's note the closet pieces it should pair with; it creates a plan of its own with its rationale in the notes; it proposes each item that plan should hold, as a target (category, type, colours, materials, warmth, formality, budget) with a note on why, not as a product; it attaches two to five product links to every item as its options, which land on your wishlist linked to the item, each with a note on why it fits and a rank (the app opens on its pick and marks it "Agent’s pick"); and it checks each candidate against what you already own.
3. **What you see in the app**: a card on **Today**, "Muse drafted … : N ideas to review", while its proposals wait, and the plan under **Wardrobe › Plans**, never made active on its own, marked "Drafted by Muse". The plan reads top to toe, a section per kind of garment, each item a card with its best option's photo, its budget, its options and where it stands. On the plan, accept, change or decline each proposed item; make the plan active if you want to keep it. Buying stays yours: an agent never marks anything bought, so a candidate stays on the wishlist until you tap **Bought it**.
4. **Iterating**: in the plan's review, tell the agent what to do with each item: **Change this** (with a note on what to change), **Don't buy** (the item stays recorded as declined, so it is never proposed again) or, on a product, **Not this one** (with a reason; the product leaves the wishlist). Then, in a conversation with the agent, ask it to check your feedback: it reads what is waiting (`get_plan_feedback`), revises the items you sent back, which return to you to review, and replaces the products you rejected, never adding one of them again.
5. **Looks**: once the items have candidates, the agent proposes a few looks per occasion of your week (`propose_look`), each mixing pieces you own with the plan's candidates so every candidate appears in at least one look, with a note on why it works. Asking it to check your feedback also covers the looks: it changes the ones you sent back, mends the ones that lost a piece (a product you rejected), and never proposes again the exact set of a look you declined. Once you own every piece of a look (Bought it lists the looks a purchase completed), **Save as outfit** makes it one of your outfits; that is your tap, never the agent's, and its later edits never change the outfit. The candidates' tiles say how many looks each is in.

## Configuration

`.env` contains committed defaults. Override any value via a `.env.local` file (gitignored) or by passing real environment variables to Docker.

| Variable                           | Description                                                                          | Default                 | Example                                                                                   |

| `METRICS_ENABLED`                  | Prometheus metrics at `GET /metrics` (request, job, push, MCP and device timings) for a scraper on the container's network; a request that came through a proxy (`X-Forwarded-For`) gets a 404 there. Pages then send their timings to `POST /metrics/vitals` | `false` | `true` |

Empty: off, nothing sent and no script on pages | empty | `http://<key>@bug.box/3` |
| `ORDER_MAIL_JMAP_TOKEN`            | Order email import: a read-only Fastmail API token (Email scope) for the account order emails are forwarded to. Product links in them become a "From your orders" review list. Empty: off, nothing polled. See `docs/deployment.md` | empty | `fmu1-…` |
| `ORDER_MAIL_SENDERS`               | The owner's own addresses, comma-separated: only mail they forwarded, with DKIM or SPF passing, is read. Required with the token | empty | `me@gmail.com,me@work.com` |

| `PUBLIC_VAPID_KEY`                 | Web push - required when `PWA_ENABLED=true`, generate with `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys` | -                | `<from web-push>` |
| `PRIVATE_VAPID_KEY`                | Web push - required when `PWA_ENABLED=true`, generate with `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys` | -                | `<from web-push>`                                             |

Generate the session signing secret (anyone who knows it can sign in as any user, so never reuse an example value; changing it signs everyone out):

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Generate VAPID keys:

```bash
npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node (see `.nvmrc`, Node 22) - install via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Docker, for Postgres. Development and tests use the shared local
  **pgvault-dev** (a sibling `../pgvault-dev` compose project: Postgres on
  `localhost:5432`, superuser `postgres`, trust auth).

```bash
nvm install && nvm use
npm install
(cd ../pgvault-dev && docker compose up -d --wait)
docker compose -f ../pgvault-dev/docker-compose.yml exec postgres \
  psql -U postgres -c 'create database closet_db'   # once
cat > .env.local <<ENV                              # gitignored
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_SCHEMA=closet_db
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASS=
ENV
npm run start:dev
```

The integration tier and the page audit never touch `closet_db`: each run
creates scratch databases on the server named by `TEST_DATABASE_URL`
(default `postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`, pgvault-dev) and drops
them afterwards.

### Scripts

```bash
npm run start:dev       # tsc --watch + node --watch + tailwind --watch
npm run build           # tsc (type-checked) to dist/, plus Tailwind, the service worker and the cache key
npm run start:prod      # node dist/main.js
npm run start:test      # the build with background removal stubbed (what Playwright
                        # and Lighthouse start; no model download)
npm run test            # Vitest unit tests (test:watch to rerun on change)
npm run test:int        # Vitest integration tests (real app in-process, scratch Postgres database per file)
npm run test:all        # both Vitest tiers in one run
npm run test:e2e        # build, then Playwright end-to-end
npm run test:cov        # both Vitest tiers with v8 coverage (coverage/), failing below vitest.config.ts thresholds
npm run audit:pages     # every page and action measured as the demo persona, see below
npm run generate:icons  # regenerate public/assets/icon.png, icon-192.png, icon-512.png and favicon.ico from icon.svg
npm run check           # format, lint, types, unit + integration in parallel (the pre-commit hook; check:static is the first four)
npm run verify:push     # build + Chromium Playwright (the pre-push hook, for a push to main; PRs are verified by CI)
npm run maintenance:reconcile [-- --dry-run] [--force]
                        # one storage reconciliation pass (needs `npm run build`; see below)
npm run user:set-password -- <email>
                        # set a locked-out user's password (needs `npm run build`; see below)
npm run cutout:fetch-model
                        # download or verify the background-removal model into MODELS_PATH
                        # (needs `npm run build`; see Background removal)
```

The server downloads the model (940 MB) into `MODELS_PATH` at its first boot,
so `start:dev` and `start:prod` fetch it once into `./models`; point
`MODELS_PATH` at an existing copy in `.env.local` to skip that. `npm run
test:int` includes one test with the real model; it runs only when
`MODELS_PATH` (or `./models`) holds it and is skipped otherwise (CI never
downloads it).

### Locked out

There is no password reset by email. Whoever runs the server sets a new
password for an account with `npm run user:set-password -- <email>` (in a
container: `docker exec -it closet npm run user:set-password -- <email>`). It
asks for the password twice without echoing it (or reads one line from piped
stdin), applies the registration rules, and signs out every existing session
of that account. An unknown email changes nothing and exits with status 1.

Neither this nor the storage maintenance command migrates the database: they
refuse, with exit status 1, a database the running build has not migrated
yet. Start the server of that build first (it migrates at boot).

### Storage maintenance

Every photo is a set of files in storage (`<uuid>.webp` plus `-nobg` and
`-thumb` variants) and one `file` row. Deleting a garment or an account
removes both, and a nightly job (03:00 in `APP_TIMEZONE`, `MAINTENANCE_ENABLED`)
keeps them describing each other: stored photo sets older than a day with no
row are deleted, rows older than a day that no garment references are deleted
with their files, and rows whose original is missing are logged. Run it by
hand, on the NAS with `docker exec closet npm run maintenance:reconcile`, or
locally after `npm run build`; `-- --dry-run` only reports.

A run that would delete anything while the `file` table is empty, more than
25 photo sets, or more than a fifth of the stored ones (once it is more than
5) deletes nothing: it logs why, reports `refused` and exits with status 3.
That is the database and the disk disagreeing wholesale (a restore, the wrong
database), not stray uploads. Check with `-- --dry-run`, then
`-- --force` deletes anyway.

### Background removal

Every garment photo gets a cutout (its background removed) on the server.
The phone first shrinks a large photo to 1600 px (JPEG) and sends only the
photo. The server queues it (the garment page shows "Removing background…"
and swaps the cutout in when it is ready, or offers "Try again" if it
failed) and runs
[BiRefNet 512x512](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/BiRefNet_512x512-ONNX)
(MIT) with onnxruntime on the CPU, in a child process, one photo at a time:
about 3 s a photo on a recent 8-core CPU (7 s for the first after a start or
15 idle minutes, which loads the model) and up to ~3.5 GB of RAM while the
model is loaded. It needs a CPU with AVX2 or better. A photo that takes over
60 s is failed; failed ones are retried nightly (03:00 in `APP_TIMEZONE`) up
to three runs. The mask editor (the pencil on the photo) edits the cutout,
and an edited cutout is never replaced by the server's.

The model is not in the image. It is downloaded into `MODELS_PATH` at boot
when it is not there yet, from a pinned URL, and refused unless its SHA-256
matches. Give it a local volume so it is fetched once; to seed or repair it:

```bash
docker exec closet npm run cutout:fetch-model   # download or verify; prints the path
```

Photos stored before background removal moved to the server (it ran in the
browser until 2026-09-26) keep the cutouts the browser made.

### Page audit

`npm run audit:pages` builds the app, boots it in process on a scratch
Postgres database with the demo persona seeded, and measures every page,
fragment, action, MCP tool and background job as Theo: server time p50/p95,
SQL statements and rows per request, response bytes. It writes
`scripts/results/audit.md` and `.json`; `-- --compare docs/perf/baseline.json`
prints what changed against the committed baseline. How a page PR uses it:
[docs/perf/README.md](docs/perf/README.md).

### Migrations

The schema is `src/db/schema.ts` (Drizzle). The app applies the migrations in
`drizzle/` on every boot, so a deploy is the migration.

```bash
# After editing src/db/schema.ts: writes drizzle/NNNN_<name>.sql and its
# snapshot. Needs no database. Read the SQL before committing it.
npx drizzle-kit generate --name <what-changed>
```

Databases created before Drizzle took over (built by MikroORM's migrations)
are adopted on their first boot: the runner checks that the last MikroORM
migration was applied and records the Drizzle baseline without running it.

A migration that converts data refuses to guess: it fails the boot, changes
nothing, and names what to fix. `0004_garment_web` (garment colours become a
fixed set, the acquisition date a plain date) stops on a colour outside the
built-in set (older builds let people type their own), an acquisition date
that is not UTC midnight, a blank category, or a share id two rows hold. To
check a database before upgrading:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT unnest(string_to_array(color, ',')) FROM garment;  -- built-in names only
SELECT count(*) FROM garment
 WHERE (date_aquired AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')::time <> '00:00'
    OR btrim(category) = '';                                       -- 0
```

### Docker build

```bash
# Build image
docker build --no-cache -f docker/Dockerfile . -t closet:latest

# Cross-compile for linux/amd64 (e.g. building on Apple Silicon for a VPS)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --no-cache -f docker/Dockerfile . -t closet:latest
```

## Deployment recommendations

For most self-hosters: deploy to a VPS via [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) or Portainer using the docker-compose above, with local storage. Back up both the Postgres database and `DATA_PATH`, taken close together: the nightly storage reconciliation deletes photos that no database row references.
