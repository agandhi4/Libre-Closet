/**
 * The built server (dist/, `npm run build` first) as src/main.ts boots it,
 * with one difference: background removal runs a stub instead of the 940 MB
 * model, which no test downloads. Playwright (playwright.config.ts) and
 * Lighthouse (lighthouserc.js) start it with `npm run start:test`; an upload
 * goes pending, as in production, and its cutout arrives as soon as the queue
 * reaches it, unless a spec holds it pending (cutout-stub.ts). And the weather comes from
 * a stand-in for Open-Meteo (weather-stub.ts: the seed's simulated New York
 * weather), so no test run calls the real service and the screenshots'
 * weather is the same on every run of a date. Configuration is the
 * environment's, as for main.ts.
