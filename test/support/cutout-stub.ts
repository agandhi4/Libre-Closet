/**
 * The test server's stand-in for the background-removal model
 * (test-server.ts), and the control a spec holds a cutout pending through.
 *
 * The queue runs one photo at a time for the whole server, and every
 * Playwright worker shares it, so the stub answers at once: a spec's cutout
 * waits only for the photos queued before it, a few ms each, never for
 * other specs' timers (#230: 3 s a photo pushed a spec's cutout past its
 * wait whenever other specs had uploaded).
 *
 * A spec that shows the pending state holds its owner's cutouts instead
 * (`cutouts.hold(email)`, cutout-hold.ts): the stub keeps any job for a
 * photo that owner uploaded inside mask() until the spec releases it, so
 * "Removing background…" is on the page for as long as the spec looks. The
 * queue waits meanwhile, so a spec releases as soon as it has seen the
 * pending page; the fixture releases what a failed spec left held, and
 * HOLD_LIMIT_MS bounds a hold whose worker died.
