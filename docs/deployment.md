# Deployment

Runs as the `closet` stack on **linux-box** (the homelab compute host; `agandhi4/homelab`, deployed checkout `/docker`), moved from the NAS on 2026-09-26 because server-side background removal needs AVX (the NAS's Celeron J4125 has none). Runbook and rollback: the homelab repo's `docs/closet-move-to-linux-box.md`.

Production env (`/docker/hosts/linux-box/closet.env`, mode 600, values never in this repo or printed):

DISABLE_REGISTRATION=true          # flip to false only while creating household accounts

PRIVATE_VAPID_KEY=<same>
CLOSET_DB_PASSWORD=<from add-app.sh>
CLOSET_DATA_DIR=/mnt/closet
CLOSET_DB_HOST=192.168.8.173

CLOSET_WEB_NETWORK=linuxbox_web
TRUSTED_PROXIES=172.23.0.0/16      # linuxbox_web: Caddy is the edge here, so X-Forwarded-For is the real client
CLOSET_MODELS_DIR=/srv/docker/closet/models
# APP_TIMEZONE defaults to America/New_York in the compose file
```

**Trusted proxies.** `TRUSTED_PROXIES` must include the address Caddy connects from (Request security). Check with the boot log line `Trusted proxies: ...` and a rate-limit hit's `for <ip>` warning: it must name the client, not Caddy.

**Demo login.** `docker exec closet npm run seed -- --persona demo --share-with <owner email>` seeds Theo (a random password, printed once; registration stays disabled, the CLI inserts the user) and shares his wardrobe with the owner's account. `--reset` (with `--share-with` again) after the bible changes; `--persona demo --remove` takes it out, and `npm run maintenance:reconcile -- --dry-run` then reports nothing. The hourly autoupdate never reseeds. A forgotten password: `user:set-password -- demo@closet.invalid`.

**Locked out.** There is no email reset. On linux-box: `docker exec -it closet npm run user:set-password -- <email>` asks for the new password twice without echoing it (or reads it from piped stdin), applies the registration rules, and signs out every session of that account (its access tokens and push subscriptions revoked with them). An unknown email exits 1 and changes nothing, and so does a database the running build has not migrated yet (it never migrates).

**Rotating the secret.** Set a new `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` (`openssl rand -hex 32`) in `closet.env`, redeploy (`./deploy.sh up linux-box closet`), then `docker exec closet npm run push:revoke-all`: the rotation signed everyone out, and a device left closed would otherwise keep receiving its account's reminders until it next opened the app (the login page drops its browser subscription then). After the restart, not before: a session still open re-sends its subscription on its next page. Everyone signs in again and re-enables notifications and reminders on the profile. Personal access tokens are unaffected (Request security, Session revocation).

Deploy now (instead of waiting for the hourly timer): on linux-box, `docker pull ghcr.io/agandhi4/closet:latest && cd /docker && git pull --ff-only && ./deploy.sh up linux-box closet` (`up` does not pull images). Data fixes go through pgvault (read freely, write only when asked, inside a transaction).

## CI and publishing

- **`ci.yml`'s `publish` job pushes `:latest` and `sha-<7>` only after `check` and `e2e` pass** (and semver tags on `v*` tags from `tag-release.yml`), amd64 only, GHCR only. Until 2026-09-25 publishing was a separate workflow racing CI, so a red run still deployed. Docs-only pushes to main (`docs/**`, `*.md`) skip CI and publish entirely; pull requests always run both jobs, docs-only ones included, because branch protection requires them. Merging to main is deploying: the homelab autoupdater redeploys within the hour. The browser job runs with the PWA on, as production does; specs sign in through `test/support/e2e-session.ts`. Load test and Lighthouse run nightly (`nightly.yml`).
