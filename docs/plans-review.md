# Wardrobe plans: the review and what each page reads

The detail behind `src/web/plans/CLAUDE.md`'s review bullets (#271, #278, epic #268), the plan page's layout (#295) and its statement counts (#167). The rules live in code: atop `src/wardrobe/plan-review.ts` (the machine) and `src/web/plans/review.ts` (the review post).

## The item review state machine (#278)

`plan_item.review` replaced the `proposed` boolean in `drizzle/0033_plan-item-review.sql` (true to `proposed`, false to `accepted`) and `0034_plan-item-drop-proposed.sql` (the drop). It is two migrations because drizzle-kit asks whether a dropped column and an added one are a rename, a prompt that needs a TTY; generating the add, then the drop, avoids it. `plan-item-review-migration.spec.ts` covers the backfill.

| Event | From | To | Owner's note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `accept` | proposed, revise | accepted | cleared |
| `change` ("Change this") | proposed, accepted | revise | written, required |
| `decline` ("Don't buy") | proposed, revise | declined | written, optional |
| `repropose` (`update_plan_item`) | revise, accepted | proposed | kept |
| `reconsider` | declined | proposed | cleared |

- **Every other pair is refused, self-moves included.** `src/wardrobe/plan-review.spec.ts` covers all 20 pairs.
- **The owner's note.** `owner_note` is kept apart from the agent's `note`. The check `plan_item_owner_note_check` refuses `revise` without one.
- **When the agent last wrote the item.** `agent_changed_at` (null: never) is set only by the agent: `propose_plan_item`'s insert and `update_plan_item`. The owner's moves, form saves and purchase adjustments never touch it, so a later owner action cannot hide feedback. `get_plan_feedback` flags a rejection `new` when `agent_changed_at` is null or older than it. It is not `changed_at > ...` of any owner write: a review post stamps its rejection and its move in one transaction, whose `now()` is equal.
- **Who writes what.** `reviewItems` (`queries.ts`) is the owner's moves, one event per call: two statements, the read and one update, with each note a `case`. `updateItem` is a content rewrite whose move depends on who wrote it (`rewriteEvent`):
  - The owner's form save accepts what is not accepted yet.
  - The agent's `update_plan_item` reproposes what is not a proposal.
  - Either one on a declined item is a 409.
- **Everything runs under the owner lock**, which every item writer holds, so the review judged is the one written over.
- **Declined items** keep their row, so the agent sees them. A new candidate link to one throws `CandidateForDeclinedItem` (409) in `changeCandidates`. A duplicate copies the item, its note and its rejections, but not its candidates, which are inert.

## The plan page as a lookbook (#295)

The owner read the first production draft as "a flat list" with no photos and no way to tell what each thing was. `plan-page.tsx` (`planSections`) now draws the plan the way the Wardrobe's grid draws garments.

- **Sections by role, top to toe**: `topToToe` (`src/wardrobe/generator.ts`, over `categoryRole` and `OUTFIT_ORDER`, custom categories last as Other; the packing list and the review use it too), each headed "Shoes · 2" (`roleGroupLabel`, the shared plural `roles` strings).
- **The status is a chip, not a grouping**: To review, With your agent, To buy, "1 of 2", Owned. Grouping by status as well split each category into up to five places at 390 px, and what the owner asked first was what each thing is. Within a section: proposals, revise, missing, partly, owned, then `byPriority`. Declined items sit apart at the end with Reconsider.
- **A card** (`#plan-item-<id>`, `data-status`): the photo on the plinth (4:5, `object-contain`), which is the first fulfilling closet garment with one, else, while still to buy, the best-ranked candidate with one (`rankCandidates`, the shopping list's order), else the garment glyph (`HangerIcon`; the app has no per-category icons). Its alt names what it shows. Then the item's title (a stretched link to its edit form), budget and priority, the options (the other candidates as 32 px thumbs, at most three, and "3 options" to the candidates page; "No options yet" and Add a product), what in the closet fulfils it, why it is short (not "nothing fits", which the chip says), the owner's note, and the review moves (Accept, Don't buy, Change this…).
- **Proposals** are counted in a banner with Review (`#plan-review`). No statement was added: the page already read the candidates.

## The review page and "Accept these"

**The page** (`GET /wardrobe/plans/:id/review`) has a snap strip (`src/web/strip/`) per proposal.

- **Order.** Strips run top to toe (`OUTFIT_ORDER`, custom categories last), then `byPriority`, under a heading per role with its count (`#review-role-<role>`, #295).
- **Tiles.** In order: Don't buy, Change this…, Keep, then the candidates in `rankCandidates` order (as `shoppingList`). The strip starts on the best candidate, else Keep. `OutfitCountSlot` is `inStrip`.
- **Under each strip** is a note for the agent. On each candidate is a "Not this one" box with a reason field.
- **Below the strips**, read-only, are the items waiting on the agent (revise) and the declined ones, each with its note. Reconsider lives on the plan page only, because a post of its own here would lose the swipes made so far.

**Every control rides in the one post**, so nothing reloads the page between swipes (owner decision, #278).

- **What the post carries.** Each strip posts `shown`, `pick` (`<item>:decline|change|keep|<garment>`), `offered` (`<item>:<garment>`, what it drew) and `note`, one per strip in `shown`'s order. Each tile posts `reject` (`<item>:<garment>`, when ticked) and `rejectReason`, one per offered candidate in its order.
- **How `readReview` pairs it.** It pairs notes with strips and reasons with tiles by that order (the browser submits in tree order). It holds `reject` to the strip's `offered`.
- **A post the page could not have sent** is the page as it stands now, with a 400.
- **Refused as posted** (400, with every pick, box and reason kept and nothing written):
  - Change this without a note.
- **A rejected pick reads as Keep**: the item is accepted without a product, the rejection still records and releases that product, Keep releases nothing else.

**`applyReview` is one owner transaction.**

- **Which items it decides.** Only `shown` items still proposed. One decided meanwhile is left as it is and logged.
- **The moves.**
  - A candidate or Keep accepts.
  - Don't buy declines.
  - Change this sends the item back for revision.
- **What is let go** (`releasedCandidates`) is judged only among `offered` ∩ current candidates. A candidate linked after the page was drawn is never judged, and a bought one is no candidate, so no rejection is recorded for it.
  - **"Not this one" always lets go**, with or without the removal box. It records a snapshot of the product in `plan_item_rejection` (`rejections.ts`), with the reason.
  - **With the removal box ticked** (it starts unticked), a picked item's unpicked candidates and every candidate of a declined item are let go too.
  - **Keep and Change this** let go of nothing else.
- **Deleted or unlinked.** A garment is deleted from the wishlist (`deleteGarment(..., 'wishlist')`) only when both hold:
  - Every link it has, in any plan and any review (`candidaciesOf`), is to an item of this post that lets it go.
  - No item of this post picked it.

  A candidate bought meanwhile is kept and logged. One kept because it stands for something else is unlinked from each item that let it go, which frees a place under the cap.
- **After the commit.** Photos go only after the commit. The toast counts what was removed (`?removed=`).

## What each page reads, and why (#167)

These were measured with `npm run audit:pages -- --only '#167'`. Every table here is tiny per owner, so the cost is the number of statements, not the query plans.

- **The whole closet.** The list, the gap view, the shopping list, Compare and a wishlist item's plan items read the plans, their items and the whole closet (`closetPieces`, about 80 rows for Theo). Matching needs every garment of each category an item names, and a category filter would save only a few rows of five categories.
- **Candidates.** The gap view and the list add `candidatesOfPlan` (photos, prices).
- **The rejected products.** `get_plan_gaps` adds `rejectionsOfPlan`.
- **Item routes** find the plan and the item in one statement (`findPlanItem`, a left join), so each miss keeps its own 404.
- **Writes guarded under the owner lock read nothing first** (`addItems`, `updatePlan`, `reviewItems`, `deleteItems`). The plan is read only to draw a refused form or to name the 404 (`itemMiss`).
- **A new plan is made active in its own insert** (a `not exists` over the owner's plans, under the lock), not by an update after it.
- **The duplicate** reads the original, its items and its candidates. It then writes:
  - the copy;
  - its items, in one insert (`copyItems`);
  - their rejections, in one `insert … select` (`copyRejections`);
  - every copy's candidates, in one `changeCandidates` (its `add` takes several sets; it used to be one call per item, eight statements each).

  The seed links a plan's candidates the same way.
- **What is left is the owner transactions' own cost.** Each nested `ownerTransaction` is a savepoint, a `set_config` and the lock again: four statements.

## The shopping list as strips (#272)

`shopping-page.tsx` draws each missing or partly item as a card holding a snap strip of its candidates, the review's pattern without its post.

- **Tiles.** The candidates in the list's order (`shoppingList`), the first centred. Nothing declines or keeps here, and "Not this one" is not offered. The centred tile alone shows (`DETAILS`, invisible on the others, so out of reach) price against budget, the mismatch, the outfit count (`inStrip`), "View product" and **Bought it** (`GET /wardrobe/:id/bought`, the form of Bought it unchanged; `buyCandidate` untouched).
- **No form.** The page has none. The strip's hidden input (`name="candidate"`) only records the centred tile for the observer; nothing reads it.
- **An item with no candidates** has no strip: "No candidates yet." and "Add a product" to the candidates picker. With candidates the link reads "Add a candidate".
- **Above the list**, the totals and "Style with my closet" (`/styling?plan=`, only when some item has a candidate, as on the review).
- **Shared parts** with the review: `candidate-tile.tsx` (`TILE`, `PLINTH`, `DETAILS`, `CandidateFace`, `PriceLine`). The wiring is the review's inline module, rooted on `#shopping-list`.
