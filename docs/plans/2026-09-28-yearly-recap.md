# Yearly recap (2026-09-28)

Issue #26. A year in review built from insights: the most worn pieces, what was added, and the cost
per wear winners. Seen in Whering's "Unpacked". **Shareable means an image export** (coordinator's
design call on the issue): the owner saves the recap as a PNG and sends it wherever they like. There
is no public link and no unauthenticated route. People the owner already shares the wardrobe with see
the page under their existing grant.

## Data

- **Nothing stored, nothing new in the schema.** The recap is insights' two statements
  (`src/web/insights/queries.ts`) read over a different window, then computed in
  `src/wardrobe/recap.ts` from the same rows with insights' own rules: cost per wear
  (`costFigures`) and colour shares (`colourShares`). It adds no query of its own.
- **The window.** Insights reads the closet over the last 365 days up to today. `InsightsWindow`
  generalises this to `{ from, to, scope }`. Insights passes `recentWindow(today)`, which is the
  same as before. The recap passes its year:
  - `from` is January 1 and `to` is the year's last day that has happened.
  - "Recent" wear days are the year's wear days.
  - A garment's lifetime wear days and its "days since" stop at `to`. So a past year's cost per wear
    is what it was on December 31.
  - `scope` is `owned`: the closet and the archive. A coat that was worn out and archived in November
    was still that year's most worn.
- **The year boundary is the household's.** `garment_wear.day` is already a date in `APP_TIMEZONE`,
  and "today" is `todayIn(APP_TIMEZONE)`. On New Year's Eve in New York, while UTC is already in
  January, the current year is still the old one, and its period ends on December 31
  (`today.spec.ts` has a row for this). No instant is ever cut at a UTC midnight.
- **The figures:**
  - wears: garment-days in the year, the insights unit;
  - pieces worn;
  - the 5 most worn by the year's wear days;
  - new additions: `acquired_on` in the year, the newest first, the count whole. A garment without
    an acquired date is not an addition, because nothing records when it came;
  - best value: insights' "best" among the pieces worn that year;
  - the colours worn: each colour's share of the year's wears;
  - the pair worn together most: insights' pairs over the year.

## UX

- **Where it lives.** `GET /wardrobe/recap[?year=YYYY][&ownerId=N]`, under Wardrobe in the dock.
  It is reached from the Wardrobe's ⋯ menu ("Year in review") and from Insights.
  - The menu entry carries `?ownerId=` on a shared wardrobe.
  - `?year=` is navigation state. Anything that is not a four-digit year up to this one is the
    current year, never a 400.
- **Access.** The recap is share-aware: it goes through `authorizeWardrobe(…, 'view')`, so a VIEW or
  MANAGE grantee sees the owner's recap and a stranger gets a 404. This is the one place a grantee
  sees figures drawn from the owner's wear log. It is an aggregate, which the owner already chose to
  share by granting the wardrobe. The export button is the owner's alone.
- **Phone first**, in one column of Atelier cards:
  1. the year's switcher (‹ 2025 · 2026 so far ›);
  2. the summary: wears, pieces worn, new pieces, and "Save image";
  3. Most worn, New this year, Best value per wear, Colours worn, and Worn together most.

  Garments link to their pages, under the share for a grantee.
- **Current year versus past years:**
  - The current year reads "2026 so far", through today ("Jan 1 – Sep 27"), and fills in as the year
    goes on.
  - A past year is the whole year, fixed: its figures stop at December 31, so later wears never
    change it.
  - The ‹ link shows only when wears exist before the year. The › link shows only for a past year.
  - `/wardrobe/recap` with no year is the current year. In early January that year is empty, and its
    empty state links to last year.
- **Too little data.** A year needs at least `RECAP_MIN_WEARS` (10) wears to be recapped. Below
  that, the page shows an empty state:
  - it says how many wears the year has;
  - for the owner, it offers the calendar;
  - it keeps the ‹ link when an earlier year has wears.

  There is no export for such a year. A year with additions but no wears is still empty: the recap
  is about what was worn.
- **The image.** A 1080 × 1350 PNG (4:5, the shape a phone's photo apps and chats show whole).
  - It shows the year's title, the three numbers, the top three most worn on the plinth, best value
    and the best pair, and the colour strip.
  - It is drawn in the light Atelier theme, whatever the phone's scheme. It is drawn at the same
    size whatever the screen's width.

## Image export: on the device, with Canvas 2D

`public/js/recap-export.js` (about 200 lines, loaded only by the owner's recap) draws the card on a
`<canvas>` from a JSON data island the page renders. `canvas.toBlob` makes the PNG. Then:

- where the browser can share files (`navigator.canShare({ files })`: iOS Safari 15 and later,
  Android), "Save image" opens the share sheet, whose "Save Image" puts the PNG in Photos;
- elsewhere, the PNG downloads (`<a download>` on a blob URL).

The PNG is rendered as soon as the page opens, so the tap shares a file that is already made.
WebKit's `navigator.share` needs the tap's user activation, which a slow render could outlive. If
the render is still running, the tap waits for it, and a refused share falls back to the download.

**Why not sharp on the server.** sharp is already a dependency, but its text goes through Pango and
fontconfig.

- The runtime image (`node:22-slim`) has no system fonts.
- Pango does not take the woff2 files the app ships: a render with Fraunces' woff2 as `fontfile`
  measured exactly the same as one without it, so it fell back.

Server-side export would mean adding fonts to the image (a Dockerfile change and TTF copies of
Inter and Fraunces) and laying the card out a second time in SVG. The browser already has both
fonts loaded (`document.fonts`), the theme's tokens, the swatches' colours and the garment
thumbnails. The thumbnails are same-origin, so the canvas is never tainted. The render works
offline too, in the installed app, from cached thumbnails.

**Why not an HTML-to-image library.** They draw the DOM through SVG `foreignObject`, which Safari
renders unreliably: images missing on the first draw, and fonts that must be inlined. They are also
a new client dependency. The card is small and fixed, so drawing it directly is simpler and
predictable.

## Seed

Theo's 13 weeks of history (anchor 2026-09-26) all fall in 2026, and 16 of his garments were
acquired in 2026. So `/wardrobe/recap` shows him a full "2026 so far": 517 wears of 54 pieces, 16
additions, best value, colours and pairs (`insights-seed.spec.ts`). 2025 has no wears, so its
recap is the empty state and 2026 has no ‹ link. Dana, with no wears, and
Riley, with nothing, show the empty state. **The seed does not change**: a year of simulated history
would rewrite every figure `insights-seed.spec.ts` pins, for no better demonstration of this page.

## Out of scope

- Any public or unauthenticated recap link, Open Graph preview or server-rendered image.
- Stored or precomputed recaps, a December push ("your year is ready"), or an MCP tool.
- Comparisons between years ("20% more wears than 2025") and "most worn outfit". Outfits are
  owner-only and not share-aware.
- Seasonal or monthly recaps. The window type would allow them, but nothing asks for them yet.
- The days dressed (distinct days with any wear). The rows are per garment, so this would need a
  third statement. Wears and pieces worn tell the story.
